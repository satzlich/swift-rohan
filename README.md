# Rohan

Rohan is an experimental structured editor with interactive math editing capabilities. 

The goal of Rohan is to provide a user-friendly interface for editing mathematical expressions, allowing users to focus on the content rather than the formatting.

We are still experimenting with the design and functionality of Rohan, so expect changes and improvements over time.
