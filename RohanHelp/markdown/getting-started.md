For details on available commands, refer to the [Commands](commands.html) section.

## 2. Smart Replacements

The app automatically replaces shortcuts with their intended elements as you type.
Here are some common replacements:

| Shortcut | Replacement               | Look          |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| `...`    | `…` (ellipsis or`\ldots`) | …             |
| `->`     | `\rightarrow` (math mode) | $\rightarrow$ |
| `bbbR␣`  | `\mathbb{R}` (math mode)  | $\mathbb{R}$  |

For details on all replacements, refer to the [Replacement Rules](replacement-rules.html) section.

## 3. LaTeX Compatibility Notes

The app supports a subset of LaTeX commands, particularly those related to math mode.
While similar, some discrepancies exist.

For details, refer to the [Discrepancy](discrepancy.html) section.
