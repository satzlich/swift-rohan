To help you avoid frustration/outrage with unexpected issues, we've compiled a list of known issues you might experience while using Rohan. We are actively working to resolve these, but in the meantime, here are some workarounds and explanations.

## Scrolling Issues

If the cursor is too distant (e.g., many pages away) from the visible area, automatic scrolling may not bring it fully into view immediately.

This is a known issue affecting other macOS developers as well. If this occurs:

- Scroll manually to reveal the cursor position, or
- Move the cursor left or right to bring it into view.

We're investigating this issue and will address it in a future release.

## Cursor Positioning

In rare cases, a line may extend slightly beyond the right margin (by half a character or more), while the cursor remains constrained within the margin. This typically happens when the cursor is positioned at the end of a line.

This appears to be a bug in the underlying layout engine. While it doesnâ€™t affect logical cursor movement, it can be visually disorienting. We're investigating and will fix this in a future update.
