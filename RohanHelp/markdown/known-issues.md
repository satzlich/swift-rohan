of known issues you might experience while using Rohan.  

## Scrolling Issues  

If the cursor is **far too distant ** (say, many many pages away) from  the visible 
area, the app's automatic scrolling may not bring it fully into view.  

This is a known issue affecting multiple macOS developers, and a solution isn't yet
available. If this occurs, simply scroll manually to reveal the cursor position.
