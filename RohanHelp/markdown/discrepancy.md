# Discrepancy

Discrepancies exist between the app's LaTeX support and standard LaTeX commands, particularly in math mode. Here are some key differences:

## Prime Marks (')

- For simple formulas like `x'` and `x\prime`, there are natural counterparts in the app.
- For formulas that mix primes and super-/sub-scripts like `x''^m` and `x''_n`, there are no natural counterparts. Use `x^{''m}` and `x^{''}_n` instead.
