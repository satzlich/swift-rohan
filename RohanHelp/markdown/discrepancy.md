# Discrepancy

## Prime Marks (')

Certain discrepancies between Rohan and LaTeX should be noted when using prime marks.

- For simple formulas like `x'` and `x\prime`, there are natural counterparts in Rohan.
- For formulas that mix primes and super-/sub-scripts like `x''^m` and `x''_n`, there are no natural counterparts. Use `x^{''m}` and `x^{''}_n` instead.
